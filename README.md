# MovieLens-Project

This is a report of estimating movie ratings using data from the MovieLens dataset to fulfill the requirements of HarvardX Data Science Certificate. Basically the aim is to predict how a user will rate a specific movie according to specific dataset characteristics.

There is only a problem with the PDF file where the commands do not work well in _Data science example_, _user and movies numbers_ and _cross validation title_.
